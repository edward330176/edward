## Career Objectives
I received my master's degree in data science from the **University of Denver**. I am particularly interested in image and natural language processing, and their applications in medicine and social science. Currently, I am a researcher at **Macau University of Science and Technology**, where I employ both machine learning and deep learning methods to better understand user-generated content (UGC). With over 15 months of research experience, I am seeking to pursue a PhD in data science. My goal is to contribute to the existing research on:

1. Developing advanced AI technologies to assist in medical imaging, diagnostics, and beyond.
2. Making AI models human-centered and aligning with human perceptions.
3. Utilizaing AI to understand the human brain. 

## Reading Can Be A Hobby!
In my leisure time, I enjoy reading books. I have created a dedicated page to list all the books I have read and enjoyed so far. I hope you all enjoy this reading feast!
